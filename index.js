// 18. Craft a JavaScript function that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string obtained by reversing the order of words.vintelor

// 19. Create a function that accesses properties of an object and extracts their values.

// 20. Develop a constructor function named "Book" that takes parameters "title" and "author" and creates an object with these properties.

// 21. Create an object named "grupStudenti" that will contain a list of students represented as objects. Each student object should have two properties: "nume" (representing the student's name) and "note" (a list of numbers representing the student's grades). Implement a method called "calculeazaMedie" within this object that calculates the average grades for each student and displays the results.

// 22. Create an array of objects named "products" containing items with properties "name" and "price." Write a JavaScript function to sort these products in ascending order based on their prices.

// 23. Explore the use of async/await in JavaScript to make HTTP requests to an API and handle the received data.

// 24. Create a function that takes two arrays of numbers as arguments and checks if they share at least one common element.

// 25. Develop a function to calculate the sum of elements in an array object. Note that the array can contain other objects.

// 26. Implement a function that sorts an array of objects based on a specific property.

// 27. Implement a JavaScript function to sort an array of objects based on a specific property.

// 28. Create a JavaScript function to find and return the most frequently occurring element in an array.

// 29. Implement a function that takes a number as an argument and returns true if it is a perfect number; otherwise, return false.

// 30. Create a JavaScript function that find and return the longest word in a string.

// 31. Create a function that takes an array of numbers and finds the largest prime number in it.

// 32. Design a function that removes all duplicate elements from an array, keeping only the first occurrence of each element.

// 32. Implement a function to check if a given number is a Fibonacci number.

// 34. Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

// 35. You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

// 36. Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

// 37. Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

// 38. Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

// 39. Given an array of integers as strings and numbers, return the sum of the array values as if all were numbers. Return your answer as a number.

// 40. Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

// For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

// The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

// 41. The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

// 42. Define String.prototype.toAlternatingCase (or a similar function/method such as to_alternating_case/toAlternatingCase/ToAlternatingCase in your selected language; see the initial solution for details) such that each lowercase letter becomes uppercase and each uppercase letter becomes lowercase. For example:

// 43. You are given an odd-length array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number. Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

// 44. You will be given an array of numbers. You have to sort the odd numbers in ascending order while leaving the even numbers at their original positions.

// 45. Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word. Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

// For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

// You need to return the highest scoring word as a string. If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string. All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
